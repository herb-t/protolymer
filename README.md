# protolymer

A simple scaffold for quick prototypes

## Dependencies

- npm install
- bower install

## Features

- Uses Polymer 1.0 and a some minimal gulp tasks (live-reload and a server using express). Not recommended for anything other than a quick prototype setup, nothing is concatenated or minified and you really want to use vulcanize when using Polymer on a real production build.
